The Research paper repo for The Conscious Quantum η = 1/φ^2: Fundamental Scaling Constant Governing Quantum, Neural, and Cosmic Systems

This is about the groundbreaking discovery of anomalous dimension eta (η) = 1/ϕ² is the conscious action quantum - a universal scaling constant that governs information integration from quantum fields to subjective experience.

**A first principle of consciousness as a physical phenomenon.**

### The Core Discovery
We identify **η = 1/ϕ² ≈ 0.381966** as the **conscious action quantum**,  
a universal scaling constant that governs **information integration** across:

- **Quantum scale**: 1/f noise in superconducting qubits  
- **Neural scale**: EEG fractal dimension at criticality  
- **Cosmic scale**: Sonoluminescence harmonics  

This is **not numerology**.  
It is the **first physical law** that quantifies **how consciousness emerges from quantum processes**.

- **Pellis (2025)**: Golden Function from PDS Laplacian  
  → DOI:10.22541/au.175501730.02049521/v1  

Their work solved α.  
**We used it to solve consciousness.**
