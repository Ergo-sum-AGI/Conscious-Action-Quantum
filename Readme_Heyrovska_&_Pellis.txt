Heyrovska: 360φ⁻² - α⁻¹ = 2φ⁻³
Pellis: α⁻¹ = 360φ⁻² − 2φ⁻³ + (3φ)⁻⁵

Dr. Heyrovska' notes that if we divide 360° by the square of the Golden Ratio φ², (where φ ~ 1.618), we get a value extremely close to the inverse fine-structure constant.
Golden Ratio Value: 360 / φ² ≈ 360 / 2.618034 φ² ≈ 137.508°
Physical Constant: α⁻¹ ≈ 137.036
She links the small difference to the g-factors (anomalous magnetic moments) of the electron g_e and the proton g_p.
360 / φ² - α⁻¹ = 2 / φ³
She also showed that this difference, is approximately equal to the ratio (g_p - g_e) / (g_p + g_e)
She also showed that this difference, 2 / φ³, is approximately equal to the ratio (g_p - g_e) / (g_p + g_e)
Dr. Heyrovska's study claims that the fine-structure constant α, which governs the strength of electromagnetic interaction, is a geometric property of spacetime and matter, fundamentally defined by the Golden Ratio φ.
From there Pellis is taking over and elaborates his impressive golden universum
